WARNING (OSSHNL-160): The primitive, 'basic/cds_thru/spectre', was not used in the last netlisting session in this
current run directory. Therefore, re-netlisting all cell views where this
primitive is instantiated.

INFO (OSSHNL-251): Mismatch found in the direction of terminal 'IB' in the placed master
'folded_cascode/CM_Bias/symbol' and its corresponding terminal in the switch master 'folded_cascode/CM_Bias/schematic',
however, this terminal is printed in the netlist because the variable
